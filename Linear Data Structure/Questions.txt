Write a few sentences describing when you would use a liked list in solving a problem and why you would do so
	Linked List can be useful over Array in situation where the Upper limit is unknown. They are not fixed-size like an Array list is. In addition, Linked List
provide easier access for new data, with the advantage of insertation and deletion without having to move addition elements over.

Write a sentence or two describing the difference between a stack and a queue. 
	Both are linear data structure but follow different types of principles. With Queues, it's data structure follows FIFO principle. 
Which is first in, first out, this type can be thought of as a line at a drive through. The first person there get their order first, thus being the first one out.
As for Stacks, it follows the LIFO principle; meaning Last In, First Out. This type can be exampled as the tower of hanoi. One has to grab the last put-on disk
access the other disk underneath. This type of logic can be applied to stacks. 

Describe a situation in which a developer would use a stack while writing a program. -2.5 points
	As mention before, the tower of hanoi example in the recursion process feature the use of stack.

In what situation would a developer use an array rather than a list while writing a program?
	Arrays list are more efficient then linked-list when the developer is trying to save memory. It is easier to debug with its indexing.
In addition, for situations where the developer knows the intended fixed-size, an array with be more optimise.
